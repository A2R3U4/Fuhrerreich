ser.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
ser.1.d:0 "After the Great War ended Serbia was left in disaster. Many cities left in ruins and corruption far deep in the government. King Alexander I established his position as apsolute ruler with his son, Peter Karađorđević as heir. Besides them, whole Balkan area is divided with Italians holding Adriatic Coast and Hungarians holding Central Croatia. King Alexander attempted to regain those territories through diplomacy and achieving his dream of creating a new, united Balkan nation with him on throne. Soon after he heard that Croatian politicians want to break free from Hungary and connect with their historical lands on Adriatic Coast. Alexander fearing potential coalition between Italy and Croatia ordered assassination on 3 top leading Croat politicians. Plot was acomplished and Croatia was diplomatically weakned. In 1930's Alexander appointed new ministers with goal to rebuild Serbia both military and economically for inevitable war against Hungary. King was more and more paranoid as months passed. His cabinet noticed that and no one was safe from potential political exile except his son, and cousin Paul Karadjordjevic. Serbian international relations hit rock bottom. Since Entante failed to give Serbia territory they requested and rightfully deserved King Alexander I tried to convice United Kingdom that Serbia is a victim and must be shown respect for their contribution against former Austria-Hungary. After United Kingdom declined both territory concessions and war reparations Serbian people started to complain against the King. Alexander's position was questioned and people were divided between current Paternal Autocracy and growing National Populists led by Svetozar Pribićević. Who knows what lies ahead, but Balkan area still has the name „Powderkeg of Europe“."
